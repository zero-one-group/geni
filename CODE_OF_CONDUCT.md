# Code of Conduct

Much of the content here is taken from the codes of conduct from various projects, namely [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) and [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Guidelines

### Be kind to others

Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
* violent threats or language directed against another person.
* discriminatory jokes and language.
* posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* unwelcome sexual attention.
* advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### Be considerate

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should consider them when making decisions.

### Disagree respectfully

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

### Take responsibility for our words and our actions

We all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.

### Be collaborative

What we produce is a sum of many dreams. Collaboration between individuals that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.

Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

### Ask for help when unsure

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

### Open meritocracy

We invite anybody, from any company, to participate in any aspect of the project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.

### Acknowledge and celebrate achievements

We celebrate team members for the work they do. We highlight the great work of others.
