# Introduction

`geni` (*/g…úni/* or "gurney" without the r) is a Clojure library that wraps Apache Spark. The name comes from the Javanese word for fire.

# Installation

Note that `geni` wraps Apache Spark 2.4.5, which uses Scala 2.12, which has [incomplete support for JDK 11](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html). JDK 8 is recommended.

Add the following to your `project.clj` dependency:

You would also need to add Spark as provided dependencies. For instance, have the following key-value pair for the `:profiles` map:

```clojure
:provided
{:dependencies [[org.apache.spark/spark-core_2.12 "2.4.5"]
                [org.apache.spark/spark-hive_2.12 "2.4.5"]
                [org.apache.spark/spark-mllib_2.12 "2.4.5"]
                [org.apache.spark/spark-sql_2.12 "2.4.5"]
                [org.apache.spark/spark-streaming_2.12 "2.4.5"]]}
```
