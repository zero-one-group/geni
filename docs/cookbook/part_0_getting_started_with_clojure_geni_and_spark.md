# Part 0: Getting Started with Clojure, Geni and Spark

## Clojure

Clojure requires Java. The latest LTS JDK version that Spark 3.0.0 is JDK 11. For that reason, we recommend using JDK 11.

This guide uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) as the main Clojure build tool. To install Leiningen, follow the install instruction on the [Leininingen website](https://leiningen.org/). Once installed, we have the `lein` command available on the terminal. To launch a regular Clojure REPL, simply run `lein repl`.

We will be using `lein` throughout this cookbook, but it is worth mentioning the other main Clojure build tool, namely [Clojure command line tools](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).
